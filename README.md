# Supervised Machine Learning  - Predicting Credit Risk

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

The data provided was used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, we will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.


The data is located in the Resources folder (`lending_data.csv`) and is imported using Pandas.


## The models

Two models are created and compared on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. 

## Tasks completed

- Create a LogisticRegression model,
- fit it to the data,
- print the model's score.
